            <p>The scientific name for carnations is Dianthus caryophyllus of the Dianthus species. Dianthus, which means “Flower of Gods” is derived from the Greek words “dios”, which translates as “god” and “anthos” which means “flower”. It also roughly translates as “flower of love”, which is truly befitting for a carnation indeed.</p>
            <p>The carnation flower symbolises Love, Captivation and Distinction and today, it’s no wonder that it’s so widely used and is the main star of many wonderful Mother’s Day bouquets. It also makes a lovely addition to any bunch because of its long-lasting freshness and fragrance.</p>
            <p>However, each colour of the carnation has its own special meaning especially in different parts of the world. So, let’s dive into the various representations and symbols of the carnation flower, shall we?</p>

                        <h2>January Birth Flowers</h2>
                    </div>
                    <div class="modal-body">
                        <p>With winter setting in, those born in January have two birth flowers—the carnation and snowdrop. Whether they’re your “birth” flowers or not, learn more about the history, meaning, and symbolism of these colorful flowers that are sure to lift your spirits during these cold winter months.</p>
                        <p>Translated from Greek, carnation is often referred to as “flower of the gods.” It grew in the wild on the hillsides of Greece and is said to have been named by Greek botanist Theophrastus. The carnation’s history dates back to when it was used in garlands, art and decor in both ancient Greece and Roman times.</p>
                        <p>In early times, carnations were predominantly pale pink and peach, but over the years the availability of colors has grown to include red, yellow, white, orange, purple, and green, as well as bi-colors and frosted varieties. According to Christian legend, the first pink carnation on Earth grew from Mary’s tears when she wept for Jesus as he carried his cross. Therefore, a pink carnation often symbolizes a mother’s unyielding love. </p>
                        <p>Snowdrops are used to express both sympathy or celebration. During happy times, it is thought to provide optimism and hope, but following a death or misfortune, it symbolizes compassion. Innocence is also linked to the snowdrop because of its color.</p>
                        <p>According to one Christian story, an angel turned snowflakes into snowdrops and gave them to Adam and Eve as a sign of hope after their banishment from the Garden of Eden.
                          Amongst pagans, the snowdrop is associated with the beginning of spring, as it is thought that the arrival of the first blooming flower signifies the end of winter.

                      <h2>February Birth Flowers</h2>
                  </div>
                  <div class="modal-body">
                      <p>With Valentine’s Day at the forefront of everyone’s mind in February, it may come as a surprise that the red rose is not February’s birth month flower. Instead, those born in the second month of the year are linked to the violet and primrose. Whether they’re your “birth” flowers or not, learn more about the history, meaning, and symbolism of the violet and primrose!</p>
                      <p>Not many flowers bloom in February (certainly not traditional roses, which are at their best in June). However, the tiny woodland plants of February brighten the landscape like purple, colorful slippers. Wild violets show off their purple-blue petals and heart-shaped leaves in the coldest months! Primroses, a small perennial woodland plant, also bloom in wintertime.
                      </p>
                      <p>The violet is one of the earliest blooming plants in the spring. Violets typically have heart-shaped leaves and asymmetrical flowers that vary in color. Many are violet, as their name suggests, while others are blue, yellow, white and cream. Some are even bicolored, often blue and yellow.
                        Native to Europe and Asia, the violet is indigenous to temperate regions in the Northern Hemisphere. Violets (Viola) are a genus of the Violaceae family. There are more than 400 species of violets in the genus.</p>
                      <p>The violet has been thought to symbolize modesty, faithfulness, everlasting love, innocence, remembrance. When presented as a flower, each color has its own meaning: yellow symbolizes high worth, white is for innocence and purity, purple means truth and loyalty, and blue is for faithfulness and devotion. </p>
                      <p>The ancient Celts were thought to believe that large patches of primrose flowers were a gateway to the fairy realm.
                        It was once believed if you ate a primrose, you would then see a fairy.
                        An ancient belief centered around the ability of a primrose to ward off evil spirits. It is also thought to provide protection, safety, and love.                        
                        In some cultures, it was thought that a primrose symbolized a woman with each petal representing a different stage of a woman’s life.</p>
                      <p>In the Victorian era, a gift of primroses meant young love, while in the language of flowers, it says “I can’t live without you.”
                        Primrose has meaning in Norse mythology as a symbol for the goddess of love, Freya.                        
                        Rubbing primroses on the udder of a milking cow, it was once believed, would increase milk production and protect butter from being stolen.</p>

                  <div class="modal-body">
                      <p>In gardens and woodland areas, daffodils are readying themselves for their early spring appearance. So, it’s no surprise that the daffodil is linked to those born in March. Whether it’s your “birth” flower or not, learn more about the history, meaning, and symbolism of the daffodil!
                      </p>
                      <p>The traditional daffodil is either yellow, white or a combination of the two, but newer varieties now include pink and orange. The classic daffodil flower is made up of six petals and a trumpet- or bell-shaped crown that is frilled at its edge.</p>
                      <p>Daffodils are best known for a single bloom on each stem, but others in the daffodil family, like the jonquil, will produce multiple blooms per stem. There are thousands of registered cultivars of daffodils!</p>
                      <p>Daffodils also go by their Latin name, Narcissus, which is the plant’s genus. Interestingly, the term “daffodil” doesn’t refer to a singular species; many flowers in the Narcissus genus go by the name. Jonquils, for example, are included within Narcissus and are sometimes called rush daffodils. So, a good thing to remember: all jonquils are daffodils, but not all daffodils are jonquils!</p>
                      <p>Because it is one of the first flowers to bloom in spring, daffodils are seen as a representation of rebirth and new beginnings. They are also thought to represent inspiration, forgiveness, and creativity.</p>

                        <h2>April Birth Flowers</h2>
                    </div>
                    <div class="modal-body">
                        <p>By April, spring is officially here and gardens are (or soon will be) bursting with color from the earliest blooming flowers. For those born in April, daisies and sweet peas have special meaning, as the two have long been recognized as the April birth flowers. The April birth month flowers are the daisy and the sweet pea. The daisy stands for innocence, purity, and true love, while the sweet pea is a way to say goodbye, send good wishes, or merely convey a thank you. 
                        </p>
                        <p>Stemming from Old English, daisy comes from “day’s eye,” referencing the daily habits of the English daisy, with its petals opening in the day and closing at night. Depending on the species, the daisy can be one of your earliest spring bloomers or among the last to appear in the fall.
                          The daisy is actually made up of two flowers. The center eye—or disc floret—is a collection of tiny florets, while the ray floret (the petals) radiate from the center, resembling the Sun. Because a daisy is made up of two flowers that work in perfect harmony, they have long been a symbol of true love.</p>
                        <p>The daisy has long represented innocence, purity, and true love.
                          Each color daisy represents something different. The white daisy is a symbol of purity and innocence; yellow means joy and friendship; pink represents affection; and red is a sign of love and romance.</p>
                        <p>The sweet pea (Lathyrus odoratus) is part of the Fabaceae family and is related to beans and other legumes. While it is not a crop pea, it is a close relative. It’s also commonly confused with the everlasting pea due to its similar look. While sweet pea has been used in some areas of the world for medicine and food, it is considered toxic to humans and animals, unlike its edible garden pea relatives.</p>
                        <p>In the language of flowers, a bouquet of sweet peas is a way to say goodbye or thank you for a lovely time. It can also mean blissful pleasure, good wishes, kindness, gratitude, and friendship.</p>
                        <p>At one point in time, it was worn for strength or to reveal the truth. Sweet peas were also worn in pockets to provide a fragrance to clothing.
                          In some cultures, the sweet pea was thought to have magical properties.</p>

                          <p>Lily-of-the-valley, with its small, dainty, bell-shape white flowers, is a perennial groundcover that spreads aggressively given the right conditions. These flowers represent sweetness and purity</p>
                          <p>Lily-of-the-Valley
                            Also referred to as Our Lady’s Tears, May lily, and May bells, Lily-of-the-valley (Convallaria majalis) is not actually a lily, but rather a member of the asparagus family, Asparagaceae. Native to Eurasia, lily-of-the-valley has become naturalized in North America, having been planted in home gardens for its simple foliage and lovely flowers.
                            It produces pendulous, bell-shape white flowers with a strong, sweet smell. It can also produce pink or purple blossoms. </p>
                          <p>In ancient astrology, lily-of-the-valley was said to be protected by the son of the goddess Maia. In Greek mythology, that son was Hermes and for the Romans, it was Mercury.
                            According to legend, lily-of-the-valley fell in love with the song of the nightingale and only bloomed with the bird returned to the woods in May.</p>
                          <p>Hawthorns are flowering shrubs in the rose family with flowers which bloom in May in small white, red, or pink clusters. Small berries, called haws, sprout after the flowers. The hawthorn is a longstanding symbol of hope.</p>
                          <p>Belonging to the genus Crataegus, hawthorn is a member of the Rosaceae (rose) family, which also includes a number of food crops such as apples, cherries, and pears. Its genus name is derived from the Greek words kratos, meaning “strength,” because of the great strength of the wood, and akis (“sharp”), referencing the thorns of most species. “Hawthorn” can be traced back to the Old English word hagathorn, with haga meaning “hedge.” 
                          </p>
                          <p>Hawthorns have long been a symbol of hope. Other associations include its ability to mark the entrance to other worlds, with a strong connection to fairies. Hawthorns are associated with the pagan symbol of fertility.
                            It was once believed that bringing a hawthorn blossom inside would be followed by illness and death. During medieval times, the smell of a hawthorn blossom was associated with the Great Plague. 
                            Many have believed that a hawthorn’s bloom marked the point of change from spring to summer.</p>

                        <p>The rose and the honeysuckle, two flowers reaching their peak during the sixth month of the year, have long been associated with June.!</p>
                        <p>Roses are one of the most recognizable flowers, often given as a sign of affection due to the fact that it’s long been a symbol of love.</p>
                        <p>The rose family (Rosaceae) is made up of more than 100 species of perennial flowering shrubs. Many are cultivated for their beautiful flowers with colors including white, yellow, pink, and red. Most rose species are native to Asia, but some have origins linked to locations in North America, Europe, and Northwest Africa.</p>
                        <p>The rose has long been a symbol of love, beauty, and affection. And each color rose holds a different meaning. A red rose means ‘I love you’ and is a sign of romance; pink represents happiness and admiration; a white rose symbolizes innocence and purity; orange means desire and excitement; yellow represents cheer and happiness, although some folklore considered it to mean jealousy. A red and white rose paired together has come to symbolize unity.
                        </p>
                        <p>The honeysuckle, with its tubular flowers, are magnets for hummingbirds and represents happiness and positive energy.</p>
                        <p>The honeysuckle emerges in the spring with fragrant flowers that have four petals and grows in two pairs or clusters. Flowers, which are tubular, range in color from white and yellow to purple, pink, and red. After the bloom is done, flowers are replaced with round berries that can be orange, red, or a shade of pink.</p>
                        <p>The name honeysuckle comes for the Middle English word honeysouke, which translated to “honey suck.” It is believed the name came from the ability to suck the sweet nectar straight from the flowers once picked. The honeysuckle traditionally symbolized happiness and affection for a new love. It has also been known to represent nostalgia for first loves or old flames.</p>
                        <p>Honeysuckles were commonly planted near homes to create a feeling of nostalgia and to honor those who have died. It is also meant to bring happiness and positive energy into your life. According to other legends, planting a honeysuckle near the home would keep away negativity and protect you from evil spirits.</p>

                        <p>Learn about the water lily and the larkspur, our two July flowers. One emerges from deep beneath the water’s surface; the other grows on a single stalk multiple feet from the ground. Nevertheless, both provide a pop of color during the early to midsummer months! 
                        </p>
                        <p>Larkspurs are a symbol of positivity and dedication. They make a great addition to any garden given their height and beautiful purple-blue blooms, but beware: these plants are poisonous!</p>
                        <p>The larkspur is a member of the buttercup family (Ranunculaceae) and is native to parts of the Mediterranean, Africa, and Europe. Larkspurs grow wild in the United States and Europe, and have become naturalized in gardens all over the world.
                          The common name “larkspur” may refer to flowers of the genus Consolida, which tend to be annuals, or to flowers of the genus Delphinium, which tend to be perennials. The plants are very closely related, with Consolida often being considered a distinct group within the Delphinium genus.
                          </p>
                        <p>The larkspur has long symbolized positivity, loving bonds, dedication, and sincerity. It can also be used to describe lightheartedness and youth. 
                          Each larkspur color holds a different meaning. Blue, which is hard to find in the world of flowers, means dignity and grace; pink symbolizes fickleness; white represents happiness and joy; and purple is a sign of first love.</p>
                        <p>The water lily represents purity and innocence, while providing a boost to aquatic ecosystems and serving as an inspiration for one of the world’s great painters.</p>
                        <p>Water lilies belong to the Nymphaeaceae family. Water lilies are perennials and come in two varieties—hardy and tropical. The flowers of the water lily, which come in classic white as well as a rainbow of options, are showy, fragrant, and the interlocking petals fan out for a depth of beauty.</p>
                        <p>Water lilies, most notably the white variety, have traditionally symbolized purity, innocence, and chastity.
                          Pink water lilies signify joy and friendship, red means passion and romance, blue represents calm and wisdom, and yellow symbolizes energy and new beginnings.
                          In Buddhism and Hinduism, water lilies are said to represent resurrection and rebirth because the flowers open and close each day. Buddhists also believe water lilies symbolize enlightenment because the beautiful flowers emerge from the dark and dirty floor beneath the surface of the water.</p>

                      <div class="modal-body">
                          <p>The August birth flowers, gladiolus and poppy, both symbolize remembrance. These two summer bloomers come in a variety of colors and make for great cut flowers.
                          </p>
                          <p>Gladiolus, a symbol of strength and love, provides height to the garden and a splash of much-needed color in the final full month of the summer season.</p>
                          <p>The flower has long been a symbol of strength, victory, healing, and honor. It has also been associated with moral character, remembrance, and intelligence.
                            In Victorian times, romantics believed that the beauty of the gladiolus could pierce another’s heart with love. In floral meanings, the flower also came to symbolize infatuation, love at first sight, and faithfulness.</p>
                          <p>Each color holds a different meaning: Red symbolizes love, romance, and passion; pink means compassion and a mother’s love; white represents innocence and purity; yellow symbolizes friendship and joy; and purple means fortune and beauty.
                            In addition to being one of the August birth flowers, the gladiolus is traditionally given as a gift for 40th anniversaries.</p>
                          <p>The poppy, known best for its red color and made famous by a poem written more than a century ago, has long been associated with those lost during times of war.</p>
                          <p>The poppy’s name comes from the Latin word pappa, meaning milk. The stalks and buds of some poppy species produce a milky, latex-like substance when cut. Most notably, the sap of the opium poppy (Papaver somniferum) has been harvested for use in pharmaceutical opiates and illicit drugs.</p>
                          <p>In addition to being a long time symbol of remembrance, poppies have long been associated with sleep and death. It also symbolizes relaxation and recovery. It is believed that poppy flowers will help you remember your loved ones who have passed.</p>

                      <p>Asters and morning glories provide a much-needed splash of color in the garden when summer begins to fade and fall makes its annual appearance. Their distinct blooms and rich symbolism make asters and morning glories flowers that carry a lot of meaning.</p>
                      <p>Asters once represented a revolution, have been used to remember soldiers lost at war, and served as muses for painters and writers.</p>
                      <p>In Greek, aster means “star,” which is a reference to the star-like appearance of the plant’s flowers. Asters have long been a symbol of love and wisdom, patience and beauty. It has also been associated with faith, friendship, and purity.</p>
                      <p>Purple asters are considered a royal color and a symbol of wisdom, white asters represent innocence, red is a sign of devotion and passion, and pink symbolizes love and kindness.
                        Some consider asters to be the zodiac flower for Capricorns.
                        The flower is given on 20th wedding anniversaries.</p>
                      <p>The morning glory is a fast-growing vine that has long been a symbol of love—both undying and unrequited.</p>
                      <p>Members of the Ipomoea genus, morning glories are known as fast-growing vines with a somewhat unique daily schedule: the flowers open in the morning and close up by the afternoon. The flower’s blue and purple colors are the most recognizable, but morning glories also appear in a range of pinks, reds, and whites. The flowers are trumpet-shaped with five large petals arranged flat around the flower head, making them quite attractive to butterflies and hummingbirds. Morning glories are toxic and should not be eaten or used for culinary purposes. The seeds of some species are known to contain small amounts of a hallucinogenic substance, too.</p>
                      <p>Like many vining plants, morning glories have long been associated with love.
                        Morning glories have symbolized love that was never returned, but have also been seen as a sign of undying love.
                        Each color holds a different meaning: blue represents enduring love, desire, and power; purple symbolizes grace, wealth, and hopefulness; pink is a sign of gratitude and energy; red means passion and strength; white, like many other flowers, symbolizes purity and innocence. </p>

                    <p>Marigolds and cosmos are both easy to grow and provide color in the garden until the first frost of the fall. Their rich history and long-held symbolism make marigolds and cosmos plants that are meaningful in so many ways. </p>
                    <p>Marigolds are known for their bright colors and strong odor and have long been associated with death and grief. They are a prominent fixture in Day of the Dead festivities, used to decorate gravesites and home altars. </p>
                    <p>Marigolds, a member of the aster family, and more specifically the Tagetes genus, have three main types: French, African (or American), and Signet, which appear in orange, yellow, red, and bi-colors, as well as other color combinations. (Pot marigolds, native to southern Europe and a member of the Calendula genus, are not a true marigold.)</p>
                    <p>The common name, marigold, is a shortening of ”Mary’s gold.” It is said to have been named for the Virgin Mary.
                      Because of their strong smell, gardeners once thought marigolds were poisonous. Many cultures believed that the bright orange and yellow colors, representing the rays of the Sun, could help guide departed loved ones to the afterlife. Some believed the colors represented the beauty and warmth of the Sun and offered a power to resurrect.
                      In more recent times, the flowers have been linked to optimism and prosperity, cheer and joy, love and strong emotions, wealth and success. The flower has also been connected with death and grief.</p>
                    <p>Cosmos is a symbol of order and balance, peace and innocence. They represent luck and have many medicinal purposes.</p>
                    <p>Cosmos bloom in a number of colors, from orange, red, and yellow to pink, purple, and white.
                      Native to Mexico, the annual flowers are daisy-like and sit atop long, thin stems that can grow up to 6 feet tall. The colorful petals radiate from a yellow center.                      
                      A member of the daisy family (Asteraceae), cosmos make a great addition to flower gardens and have naturalized along roadsides and in fields across many parts of the United States.</p>
                    <p>The genus name comes from the Greek word kosmos, meaning order and harmony of the universe.
                      The flowers have long symbolized order, harmony, and balance. Others believe it is a sign of peace, love, joy, and innocence.
                      A red cosmos represents love and passion; pink means a mother’s love; yellow symbolizes friendship; white is a sign of faithfulness and devotion.
                      It was once thought that cosmos could attract fairies to gardens.
                      There was an element of luck associated with growing cosmos, as they were thought to repel unwanted insects from destroying other plants.
                      The plants have many medicinal properties, including anti-inflammatory and antibacterial. Over the years, they have been used to fight infections, treat skin issues, improve circulation, and more.</p>

                    <p>November’s birth flower, the chrysanthemum, recalls the vibrant colors of autumn leaves. Learn about the meaning and symbolism of chrysanthemums.
                    </p>
                    <p>Also known as simply as “mums,” chrysanthemums can be seen in all sorts of autumn decor. The word, “chrysanthemum,” comes from the Greek prefix chrys- meaning golden and -anthemion, meaning flower. Its original colors were golden hues, though mums now come in many colors—orange, burgundy, purple, red, and so on!</p>
                    <p>A native to Asia with a history that dates back to 15th century B.C., chrysanthemum symbolism often originates from its original birthplace.
                      In Japan, there’s even a “Festival of Happiness” to celebrate this flower each year.                      
                      Both the Chinese and Japanese consider chrysanthemums a powerful emblem of youth. The Chinese also believe that it prevents gray hair. 
                      A symbol of the sun, the Japanese consider the orderly unfolding of the chrysanthemum’s petals to represent perfection.
                      Confucius once suggested chrysanthemums be used as an object of meditation.
                      It’s said that a single petal placed in the bottom of a glass of wine enhances longevity.</p>
                    <p>A red chrysanthemum means “I love you.”
                      A white chrysanthemum means innocence, purity, and pure love. 
                      A yellow chrysanthemum means slighted love. </p>

                      <p>December’s flowers may be very different from each other—one being a bulb and the other an evergreen shrub—but they both symbolize hope!
                      </p>
                      <p>Holly symbolizes a wish for domestic happiness. 
                        Although some animals and birds enjoy holly berries, they are semi-toxic to humans.                        
                        The good news is that deer tend to avoid eating holly due to their sharp leaves, which makes them a deer-resistant plant for gardens.</p>
                      <p>Narcissus conveys that you want your beloved to stay just the way they are. 
                        While there are many types of flowers in the genus Narcissus (including the daffodil), the paperwhite is the winter-growing variety and the birth flower for December.
