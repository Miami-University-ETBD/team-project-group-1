          <p class="about">Floriography (language of flowers) is a means of cryptological communication through the use or arrangement of flowers. Meaning has been attributed to flowers for thousands of years, and some form of floriography has been practiced in traditional cultures throughout Europe, Asia, and Africa. History is riddled with stories of women in society utilizing flowers to pass messages to lovers, friends and enemies. Floriography even play a large role in William Shakespeare’s works. Mythologies, folklore, sonnets, and plays of the ancient Greeks, Romans, Egyptians, and Chinese are peppered with flower and plant symbolism—and for good reason.</p>

          <p>Since the dawn of civilization, flowers have carried symbolic importance—witness the verse from the "Song of Solomon":</p>
      <blockquote cite="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Song%20of%20Solomon%201&version=ESV">
        I am the rose of Sharon, and the lily of the valleys.

      <p>The language of flowers has been recognized for centuries in many countries throughout Europe and Asia.
        For millennia, people have assigned meaning to flowers. Across a diversity of cultures in Europe, Asia, and Africa, some form of floriography — or the use of flowers to communicate specific meanings — has been in play for thousands of years.
        From the flower references in the Christian bible to the teachings of Buddha, Chinese medicine to Japanese folklore, flowers have long held special meaning across cultures and time. 
      </p>
      <p>However, interest in floriography soared in Victorian England and in the United States during the 19th century. It’s been documented that harem women utilized “Floriography” in order to communicate without their guards knowledge.  The renewed Victorian era interest in the language of flowers finds its roots in Ottoman Turkey, specifically the court in Constantinople and an obsession it held with tulips during the first half of the 18th century. The Victorian use of flowers as a means of covert communication bloomed alongside a growing interest in botany. Floriography was popular during the Victorian age (roughly 1820–1880) in Britain, while in France it was popularized during 1810–1850, and in the United States during 1830–1850. </p>
      <p>Although most of the floriography we know today has its roots in the Victorian Era, however, if you want you can still learn more about floriography in Asia and elsewhere.</p>

          <p>The use of flowers to communicate has its origins in eastern Asia. In Japan, the use of flower language was so prevalent that even Samurai used images of flowers on their family crest; this Japanese practice is still known as hanakotoba. The Japanese took this idea of giving specific meaning to different flowers to its ultimate level with Hanakotoba, the language of flowers. Hanakotoba is a nuanced language that was created to help communicate one’s feelings and thoughts to another through the presentation of flowers. Even the different colors of a specific flower could mean very different things.</p>
          <p>The importance of flowers can be seen throughout Japanese culture. The Imperial Seal of Japan is a Chrysanthemum, or Kiku. The Cherry Blossom, or Sukura, is the national flower, and is celebrated with festivals throughout Japan every spring. The art of arranging flowers, or Ikebana, is even one of the three arts of refinement in Japan, along with the tea ceremony and incense appreciation.</p>
          <p>Floriography is also seen in the teachings of Buddhism, where flowers often act as symbols of enlightenment, wisdom and diving teaching.
            However, flower language has also evolved over time and geography. In the Hindu religion, for example, the marigold has become an intrinsic feature of funerals as it symbolizes grief and mourning. The marigold is native to Central America, however, and was only introduced to India three centuries ago;  now it is one of the most common symbols in Hinduism. In the West, marigolds are seen as symbols of joy and optimism.
