            <h2>Fun Facts</h2>
            <p>Flowers are not only beautiful, but they also have many interesting facts associated with them. Here are a few fun facts about flowers:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The world's largest flower is the Rafflesia arnoldii. It can grow up to three feet across and weigh up to 15 pounds.</li>
                <li>The Titan arum, also known as the "corpse flower," is the world's largest unbranched inflorescence. It can grow up to 10 feet tall and smells like rotting flesh.</li>
                <li>The iris is named after the Greek goddess of the rainbow, who was also a messenger for the gods. This is because of the many colors of irises.</li>
                <li>The lotus flower is considered sacred in many cultures and religions, including Hinduism and Buddhism. It is a symbol of purity, enlightenment, and rebirth.</li>
                <li>The stamen of the orchid flower is unique because it has only one pollen sac. This is in contrast to other flowers that typically have two or more pollen sacs per stamen.</li>
